Reverse engineering of nmap TCP sent packages to a target machine

##Help us Develop Nmapalyzer

Nmap is a well known tool for scanning ports and is used by hackers to fingerprint and obtain more information about their targets. While these kind of open source tools have been in the middle of controversy regarding their purpose and utility to blackhats, right now,system administrators do not count with easy to install ‘counter attack’ open source tools to help mitigate or alert when scans are being done to the network using a sophisticated and sneaky tool like Nmap.

From the security perspective, there are more open source tools that actually help hackers than free tools that help protect systems networks. More than ever, system administrators and organizations have a daunting task to protect their networks without cheap and effective counter attack tools.

Nmapalyzer is aim to help network admins and security related professionals to understand more about the techniques used by NMAP, creating a tool that does a sophisticated recognisance of NMAP scans, easy to install and at the same time presenting this data in a visual and comprehensive way to System/Network administrators.
